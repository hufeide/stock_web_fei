# Agent Context Update Note

Planned action (not executed due to local repo branch context):

- Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` to update the Copilot/agent context files with technology hints from this plan.
- Add technology: "vanilla-js frontend, optional Node.js proxy"
- Preserve manual additions in agent files between markers.

Reason for deferral:
- The repository working directory currently has no active feature branch context for the script; executing the script may create agent files at repo root which require manual review.

If you want me to run the agent update script anyway, confirm and I will run it and then present the diffs for review.
